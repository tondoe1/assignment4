# WEBD 1000 - Assignment 4 

##  Tutorial 5 Case Problem 2 (HTML 448)

**Due as posted in Brightspace**

### Important Note #1: 
There is an element in the rubric that deals with Chapter 4 material not covered in the textbook instructions, so **for full marks you will need to add a gradient style to the site**. You can pick a different element to add a gradient to, or follow my example in the screenshot below where a pink-to-white linear gradient was applied to the entire page background for the desktop version of the site.
 
### Instructions:  

- Clone this repository to your local machine
- The textbook starter files for the Case Problem have already been loaded into the GitHub repository for you
- Make the required changes in the cloned folder, and **commit & push** the entire folder up to GitHub 
- This is to be an individual assignment (i.e. not group work).
- The **rubric/checklist** on Brightspace **should act as your guide of what to demonstrate in the video**. The video file (or link) should be submitted to **Brightspace** before the deadline.

###  Important Note #2: 

You must **ensure that your solution has been committed & pushed to GitHub at least three times** while working on the assignment (i.e. at different stages of completion) in order to get credit for the assignment.  

### Tasks:  

Complete Case Problem #2 from Tutorial 5 on page **HTML 448**(Section 5-21g) of the textbook.

## Submission Instructions
### Video Recording Submission:

You will demonstrate the completion of this project via a **video screen-capture recording** of you navigating your completed Website in the **browser** (e.g. Chrome) and viewing your **code** in the text editor (e.g. NotePad++) to show completion of the rubric/checklist. You will post **either your video file or a link to it** (e,g, a Microsoft Stream recording, make sure to give the instructor permissions to watch it), to the Brightspace Assignment 4 Dropbox prior to the deadline. If you are not sure of how best to capture such a video, seek advice from the instructor prior to the deadline.

NOTE: YOU DO NOT NEED TO HAVE AUDIO OR SPEAK DURING THE VIDEO. HOWEVER, IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO, THEN YOUR VIDEO MUST VERY CLEARLY SHOW EVERYTHING IN THE RUBRIC/CHECKLIST AS THERE WILL BE NO AUDIO TO TELL WHAT IT IS THAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SHOWING IN A GIVEN STEP.
